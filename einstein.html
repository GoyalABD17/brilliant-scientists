                    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                        Born on <strong class="text-indigo-600">March 14, 1879</strong>, in Ulm, WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany, Albert Einstein would grow to become one of the most influential physicists of all time. His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. The family moved to Munich when Albert was an infant, where his father and his uncle founded an electrical engineering company.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                        Einstein's early education was somewhat unconventional. He was a slow speaker as a child, leading his parents to worry, but he showed a profound curiosity and a deep interest in understanding the natural world from an early age. He famously rejected rote learning and authoritative teaching methods, preferring to explore concepts independently.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                        He struggled with the rigid schooling system in Germany. At the age of 15, he dropped out of school in Munich and later attempted to enter the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich (ETH Zurich) but failed the entrance exam. After attending a secondary school in Aarau, Switzerland, for a year, he finally gained admission to ETH Zurich in 1896, where he trained as a teacher of physics and mathematics.

                        Albert Einstein <strong class="text-red-600">died on April 18, 1955</strong>, in Princeton, New Jersey, United States, leaving behind a legacy that continues to shape our understanding of the universe.

                Revolutionary Scientific Career
            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                Einstein's most productive period, often referred to as his "Annus Mirabilis" (Miracle Year), was in <strong class="text-green-600">1905</strong>. While working as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland, he published four groundbreaking papers that fundamentally changed physics:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg space-y-2 mb-4 pl-4">
                <li>
                    <strong>The Photoelectric Effect:</strong> This paper explained the emission of electrons from a material when light shines on it, proposing that light consists of discrete energy quanta (photons). For this work, he received the <strong class="text-yellow-600">Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Brownian Motion:</strong> He provided a theoretical explanation for the seemingly random movement of particles in a fluid, confirming the existence of atoms and molecules.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Special Relativity:</strong> This theory introduced the concepts of time dilation and length contraction, establishing that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers and that the speed of light in a vacuum is independent of the motion of all observers. It gave us the famous equation, $E=mc^2$.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mass-Energy Equivalence ($E=mc^2$):</strong> As a consequence of special relativity, this paper demonstrated that mass and energy are interconvertible, meaning a small amount of mass can be converted into a vast amount of energy.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                In <strong class="text-green-600">1915</strong>, Einstein completed his <strong class="text-purple-600">General Theory of Relativity</strong>, which extended special relativity to include gravity. This theory describes gravity not as a force, but as a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. It predicted phenomena like black holes and gravitational lensing, which have since been experimentally confirmed.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg">
                Throughout his career, Einstein continued to work on quantum mechanics and unified field theory, seeking to combine all fundamental forces of nature into a single comprehensive theory, though he never fully succeeded in this endeavor. His work profoundly influenced not only physics but also philosophy and our understanding of the cosmos.

                <li>
                    <strong>He played the violin:</strong> Music was an integral part of Einstein's life. He started playing the violin at age six and continued throughout his life, finding solace and inspiration in it. He once said, "I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music."
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>He was offered the presidency of Israel:</strong> In 1952, Einstein was offered the second presidency of Israel, a ceremonial role, but he declined, stating he lacked the "natural aptitude" and experience for such a position.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>His brain was preserved:</strong> After his death, without his family's permission, pathologist Thomas Harvey removed Einstein's brain during his autopsy. Harvey preserved it for scientific study, and it was later sectioned and sent to various researchers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>He had an illegitimate daughter:</strong> Before his marriage to Mileva MariÄ, Einstein had a daughter named Lieserl, born in 1902. Her fate is largely unknown; she is believed to have either died in infancy or been given up for adoption.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>He loved sailing but wasn't a good swimmer:</strong> Einstein enjoyed sailing, which he found relaxing. However, despite his love for the water, he never learned to swim.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>He helped invent the refrigerator:</strong> In the late 1920s, Einstein and his former student LeÃ³ SzilÃ¡rd patented a design for a unique, absorption-style refrigerator. It used a different method of cooling and was designed to be more environmentally friendly and reliable.
