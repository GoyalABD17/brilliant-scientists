                        Biography & Early Life
                    </h2>
                    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                        Born on <span class="key-date">March 14, 1879</span>, in Ulm, Württemberg, Germany, Albert Einstein would grow to become one of the most influential physicists of all time. His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. The family moved to Munich when Albert was an infant, where his father and his uncle founded an electrical engineering company.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                        Einstein's early education was somewhat unconventional. He was a <span class="key-achievement">slow speaker as a child</span>, leading his parents to worry, but he showed a profound curiosity and a deep interest in understanding the natural world from an early age. He famously rejected <span class="key-achievement">rote learning and authoritative teaching methods</span>, preferring to explore concepts independently.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                        He struggled with the rigid schooling system in Germany. At the age of 15, he <span class="key-achievement">dropped out of school in Munich</span> and later attempted to enter the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich (ETH Zurich) but failed the entrance exam. After attending a secondary school in Aarau, Switzerland, for a year, he finally gained admission to <span class="key-achievement">ETH Zurich in 1896</span>, where he trained as a teacher of physics and mathematics.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg">
                        Albert Einstein <span class="key-date">died on April 18, 1955</span>, in Princeton, New Jersey, United States, leaving behind a legacy that continues to shape our understanding of the universe.

                Einstein's most productive period, often referred to as his <span class="theory-highlight">"Annus Mirabilis" (Miracle Year)</span>, was in <span class="key-date">1905</span>. While working as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland, he published four groundbreaking papers that fundamentally changed physics:

                    <strong class="key-achievement">The Photoelectric Effect:</strong> This paper explained the emission of electrons from a material when light shines on it, proposing that light consists of discrete energy quanta (photons). For this work, he received the <span class="award-highlight">Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921</span>.

                    <strong class="key-achievement">Special Relativity:</strong> This theory introduced the concepts of <span class="theory-highlight">time dilation and length contraction</span>, establishing that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers and that the speed of light in a vacuum is independent of the motion of all observers. It gave us the famous equation, <span class="theory-highlight"><strong>E = MC<sup><big>2</big></sup></strong></span>.

                In <span class="key-date">1915</span>, Einstein completed his <span class="theory-highlight">General Theory of Relativity</span>, which extended special relativity to include gravity. This theory describes gravity not as a force, but as a <span class="theory-highlight">curvature of spacetime</span> caused by the presence of mass and energy. It predicted phenomena like <span class="key-achievement">black holes and gravitational lensing</span>, which have since been experimentally confirmed.

            <p class="text-lg">
                Throughout his career, Einstein continued to work on quantum mechanics and unified field theory, seeking to combine all fundamental forces of nature into a single comprehensive theory, though he never fully succeeded in this endeavor. His work profoundly influenced not only physics but also philosophy and our understanding of the cosmos.
