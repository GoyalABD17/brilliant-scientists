                        Biography & Early Life
                    </h2>
                    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                        Born on <span class="key-date">July 10, 1856</span>, in Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia), Nikola Tesla would become one of history's most brilliant and eccentric inventors. His father, Milutin Tesla, was an Eastern Orthodox priest, and his mother, Đuka Mandić, was an inventor of household appliances. From his mother, Tesla inherited his inventive spirit and <span class="key-achievement">photographic memory</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                        Tesla displayed an extraordinary mind from a young age, with a knack for mathematics and a vivid imagination. He attended the Imperial-Royal Technical College in Graz, Austria, where he studied electrical engineering. It was there that he first conceived the idea for the <span class="key-achievement">alternating current (AC) motor</span>. He later studied at the University of Prague.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                        After working in Budapest and Paris, where he improved electrical equipment, Tesla emigrated to the United States in <span class="key-date">1884</span>, arriving in New York City with little more than the clothes on his back and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison. Their initial collaboration soon turned into a fierce rivalry over the future of electrical power.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg">
                        Nikola Tesla <span class="key-date">died on January 7, 1943</span>, alone in a New York City hotel room, having lived a life dedicated to scientific discovery and invention, much of which was ahead of its time.

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                Tesla's career was marked by groundbreaking inventions and visionary concepts, particularly in the field of electricity and magnetism. His most significant contributions include:

His system ultimately became the <span class="key-achievement">global standard for power transmission</span>.
