                    </h2>
                    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                        Born on <strong class="text-indigo-600">July 10, 1856</strong>, in Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia), Nikola Tesla would become one of history's most brilliant and eccentric inventors. His father, Milutin Tesla, was an Eastern Orthodox priest, and his mother, Đuka Mandić, was an inventor of household appliances. From his mother, Tesla inherited his inventive spirit and photographic memory.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                        Tesla displayed an extraordinary mind from a young age, with a knack for mathematics and a vivid imagination. He attended the Imperial-Royal Technical College in Graz, Austria, where he studied electrical engineering. It was there that he first conceived the idea for the alternating current (AC) motor. He later studied at the University of Prague.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                        After working in Budapest and Paris, where he improved electrical equipment, Tesla emigrated to the United States in <strong class="text-green-600">1884</strong>, arriving in New York City with little more than the clothes on his back and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison. Their initial collaboration soon turned into a fierce rivalry over the future of electrical power.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg">
                        Nikola Tesla <strong class="text-red-600">died on January 7, 1943</strong>, alone in a New York City hotel room, having lived a life dedicated to scientific discovery and invention, much of which was ahead of its time.

                Revolutionary Scientific Career
            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                Tesla's career was marked by groundbreaking inventions and visionary concepts, particularly in the field of electricity and magnetism. His most significant contributions include:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg space-y-2 mb-4 pl-4">
                <li>
                    <strong>Alternating Current (AC) System:</strong> Tesla's development of the AC electrical system, including the induction motor and polyphase power distribution, was crucial to the "War of Currents" against Edison's direct current (DC). His system ultimately became the global standard for power transmission.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tesla Coil:</strong> Invented in <strong class="text-yellow-600">1891</strong>, the Tesla coil is a resonant transformer circuit that produces high-voltage, low-current, high-frequency alternating-current electricity. It was used for innovative experiments in electrical lighting, phosphorescence, X-ray generation, and radio.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Radio Technology:</strong> Though Marconi is often credited, Tesla's patents for radio communication predate Marconi's. He demonstrated wireless control of a boat in <strong class="text-purple-600">1898</strong>, proving the principles of radio.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Remote Control:</strong> His wirelessly controlled boat demonstration also laid the foundation for remote control technology.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>X-rays and Radioactivity:</strong> Tesla conducted early experiments with X-rays, recognizing their potential dangers, and was aware of phenomena related to radioactivity.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                Tesla dreamed of free, wireless energy for the world, leading to his ambitious but unfinished project, the Wardenclyffe Tower, designed for transatlantic wireless telephony and broadcasting. His visionary ideas often outpaced the technological capabilities and financial backing of his time.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg">
                Despite facing financial difficulties and public skepticism later in his life, Tesla's work laid the essential foundation for modern electrical power systems and many wireless technologies we use today.

                <li>
                    <strong>Photographic Memory & Visualization:</strong> Tesla possessed an eidetic memory, allowing him to memorize entire books and visualize complex inventions in his mind with extreme clarity, often building them without ever drawing schematics.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Obsessive Compulsive Tendencies:</strong> He had several phobias and obsessions, including a strong aversion to pearls (which led him to send an assistant home for wearing them) and a compulsion to do things in multiples of three.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fascination with Pigeons:</strong> In his later years, Tesla developed an unusual devotion to pigeons, particularly a white pigeon he claimed to love as one would a human being.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Never Married:</strong> Tesla never married, believing that abstinence from sexual relations helped his scientific work, though he did believe in love.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>"Death Ray" Rumors:</strong> Towards the end of his life, he claimed to have invented a "teleforce weapon," or "death ray," though no evidence of such a device was ever found.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fluency in Multiple Languages:</strong> In addition to his native Serbo-Croatian, Tesla was fluent in Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin.
